# Fix Me Plz - Back End
You have a buggy-not-runnable-undocumented backend service. It's dead simple, you just have to read the codes very-very carefully.

## Tasks
run nodemon app.js, fix the reported errors. Once it runs properly, your work is half done. The rest depends on how well you test it.

> hint: use Postman, Insomnia, curl, etc

## Run The Unit Testing
after you think that your code is already correct, run the unit testing but dont forget to **stop your nodemon first..**
cause we use server for chaiHttp.

### Note
**Don't Edit The Testing!!**


Good luck and have fun! ðŸŽ‰
